# Kaggle_HousePrice
As a beginner for Data Science, I run overall processes from Pre-process data, Exploring data analysis, Feature Selection, Building Model and Validation Model(hidden layer and activation function).
I applied Neural Network Regression model(NN) to handle this project. Although I did not get a good score on Kaggle Competition, I learn the whole process and understand each section what has been done, including updating the data and scripts on Github.
